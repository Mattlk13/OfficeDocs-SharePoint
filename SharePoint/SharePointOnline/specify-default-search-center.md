# Search Center settings

As a global or SharePoint admin in Microsoft 365, you can specify where searches should go for your classic site collection or site by specifying the URL of your Search Center. For example, if you have created an Enterprise Search Center where users can search everything in your company, you can enter the URL of that site here.
  
## Enter the address of your Search Center
<a name="__goback"> </a>

1. Go to the [More features page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=classicfeatures&modern=true), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) for your organization.

2. Under **Search**, select **Open**.
