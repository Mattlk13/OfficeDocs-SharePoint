# Manage automated form processing

Admins can show or hide [automated form processing options in SharePoint document libraries](https://support.office.com/article/form-processing-in-sharepoint-cecf236f-224d-4630-9082-b5c79e0cd59a) through the admin center. 

* During private preview, the menu options will either show in all libraries or none.
* The options are shown in the **Automate** menu under the heading **[AI Builder](/ai-builder/overview)**.
* Creating a [form processing AI model](/ai-builder/form-processing-model-overview) from SharePoint applies the model to the library it was created in. 
  * When the model is applied, a [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started) flow is created that is triggered when new files are added to the library.
  * The flow will extract information from files that match the model. 
  * The information will be available in the values of the columns in the library. 
* The [default environment for the Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview#the-default-environment) will be used for all form processing models built through these options.
