# Manage app licenses for a SharePoint environment

As a SharePoint or global admin in Microsoft 365, you can use the SharePoint admin center to manage licenses for apps purchased from the SharePoint Store, regardless of whether you purchased them. All apps available from the SharePoint Store have built-in licenses that SharePoint recognizes. An app license provides digital verification of a user's right to use an app. 
  
It is important to keep track of the number of licenses that are available for each app so that the number of app users does not exceed the number of available licenses. If necessary, you can buy additional licenses for an app. 
  
From the admin center, you can also add users to an app, or delegate management of a license to someone else.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The Office and SharePoint App Stores are optional services operated by Microsoft Corporation or its affiliate from any of Microsoft's worldwide facilities. The apps available in the Store are provided by various app publishers, and are subject to the app publisher's terms and conditions and privacy statement. Your use of any of these apps may result in your data being transferred to, stored, or processed in any country where the app publisher, its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. Availability of specific apps and payment methods depends on your region and service. You can review the app publisher's terms and conditions and privacy statements before downloading and using such apps. 
  
1. Go to the [More features page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/sharepoint?page=classicfeatures&modern=true), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](./sharepoint-admin-role.md) for your organization.

>[!NOTE]
>If you have Office 365 Germany, [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=848041), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page. <br>If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), [sign in to the Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850627), then browse to the SharePoint admin center and open the More features page.
 
2. Under **Apps**, select **Open**.

3. Select **Manage Licenses**. 
    
4. In the list of apps, select the app you want to update or view. 
    
5. On the Manage App License page, you can review the details about the app license, such as the number of licenses available for users or the license type. You can also take a number of actions. 
    
6.  Do any of the following: 
    
|****To do this:****|****Do this:****|
|:-----|:-----|
|Assign licenses to specific users  <br/> | Under **People with a License**, select **assign licenses**, enter the name(s) of the people you want to add, and then select **Add User**.  <br/> |
|Buy more licenses  <br/> | Under **People with a License**, select **buy**, and then follow the steps to sign in with your [Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026324/microsoft-account-how-to-create) to buy the additional number of licenses than you want.  <br/> |
|Remove app licenses  <br/> | Under **View a purchase**, select the arrow next to **Actions** and then select **Remove this license**.  <br/> |
|Recover app licenses  <br/> | When you recover a license, you basically reacquire it from the SharePoint Store. You might need to do this if your license gets out of sync with Office.com or if you are moving the license to a new deployment (for example, in a disaster recovery scenario).  <br/> 
Under View a purchase, select the arrow next to Actions, and then select Recover license. On the Details page for the app in the SharePoint Store, select More Actions, and then select Recover license again. When prompted, sign-in with your Microsoft account. |
|Add a License Manager  <br/> |
In the License Managers section, select add manager. Type the name(s) of the people you want to add (or select the address book icon to select people). When you have finished typing or selecting names, select Add Manager underneath the text box. |
   
> [!NOTE]
>  If this is a free app, some of the actions in the table above will not apply. <br>A user cannot grant an app permissions to do more than that user has permissions to do.
