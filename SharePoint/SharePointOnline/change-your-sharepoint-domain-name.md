# Change your SharePoint domain name

Unfortunately, it isn't possible to change the SharePoint domain name for your organization in Microsoft 365. For example, if the name of your organization changes from "Contoso" to "Fabrikam," you can't change  `contoso.sharepoint.com`  to  `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`.
  
To use the domain name `fabrikam.sharepoint.com`, you would need to purchase a new Microsoft 365 subscription and move all email, files, and any other data you want to keep to the new subscription.
  
> [!NOTE]
> To change the address of a site, for example, from `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample1` to  `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/sample2`, you can use the new SharePoint admin center. For info, see [Change a site address](change-site-address.md).
