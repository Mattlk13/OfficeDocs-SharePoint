# Step 2: Scan and assess Box users

>[!Note]
>This release currently supports the migration of up to approximately 1500 Box accounts in a single migration. For larger migrations, we recommend you use the [Mover migration tool](https://Mover.io).



Box users are scanned automatically for you. Once the scans are complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.

A table summary appears at the top to give you an at-a-glance overview of your users and content size.

1.  Review the scanned users. Select **Look for new users** if you want to manually search for more users.

2. Search for specific text, or select a filter to review the list more easily.

3. Once the scan is complete, select **Download scan log** from the menu bar, to troubleshoot any issues. The file will be available from your task bar or downloads folder: **Scan task report.csv**
