# Migrate Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 with Migration Manager

>[!Note]
>This release currently supports the migration of up to approximately 10,000 Google Workspace accounts in a single migration. For larger migrations, we recommend you connect with [FastTrack](https://www.microsoft.com/fasttrack).

Collaborate all in one place by migrating your Google documents, data, and users to OneDrive, SharePoint, and Teams in Microsoft 365.

## How does it work?

- **Step 1:** [Connect to Google](mm-google-step1-connect.md).   Sign in to your Google account and add the Microsoft 365 migration app to your Google Workspace account custom apps. 
- **Step 2:** [Scan and assess](mm-google-step2-scan-assess.md) Google Drive accounts are scanned automatically for you. Once the scans are complete, download the generated reports and logs to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.
- **Step 3:** [Copy to Migrations list](mm-google-step3-copy-to-migrations.md) After a Google Drive has been scanned and determined ready, add them to your migration list.
- **Step 4:** [Review destination paths](mm-google-step4-review-destinations.md)  We automatically map source paths to any exactly matching destination paths. Ensure content is being copied to the right place by reviewing and modifying as needed for each destination path.
- **Step 5:** [Map identities](mm-google-step5-map-identities.md)   Map your groups and users in Google Drive to an account in Microsoft 365 to migrate your Google Drive sharing settings.
- **Step 6:** [Migrate and Monitor](mm-google-step6-migrate-monitor.md) After reviewing your migration setup, migrate your Google accounts and monitor the progress


## Get started

To get started:

Go to the [Migration Manager page of the new SharePoint admin center](https://aka.ms/ODSP-MM-FS), and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.

Make sure that you have:

- **Access to the destination**: You must either be a global admin or OneDrive/SharePoint admin to the Microsoft 365 tenant where you want to migrate your content. 

- **Access to the source**: Have Google account credentials that have read access to any Google user account you plan to migrate.

- **Prerequisites installed:** Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.
