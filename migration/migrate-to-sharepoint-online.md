- **Azure Data Box**. Want to remove the dependency on your WAN link to transfer data?  The Microsoft Azure Data Box is a service that lets you order a device from the Microsoft Azure portal. You can then copy TBs of data from your servers to the device, ship it back to Microsoft, and your data is copied into Azure. Once your data is in Azure, use SPMT to migrate content to SharePoint. To learn more, see [Migrate using the Azure Data Box](how-to-migrate-file-share-content-to-SPO-using-AzureDataBox.md).</br>

- **OneDrive sync app**  To migrate users' Windows known folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Screenshots, and Camera Roll) to OneDrive, you can use [Known Folder Move](/onedrive/redirect-known-folders). If users want to move other files from their local computer or a network file share to OneDrive or SharePoint, it's typically easiest for them to use the OneDrive sync app. Users can simply drag the files or folders to a folder they're syncing.
